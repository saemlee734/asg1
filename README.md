# Assignment 1: Interactive WebGL Paint App ðŸŽ¨

## Website
https://saemlee734.github.io/asg1/asg1.html

## Overview

This project is part of **CSE-160: Introduction to Computer Graphics**, and implements a simple paint program using **WebGL**. Users can interact with a canvas to draw shapes like **points**, **triangles**, and **circles** by clicking or dragging the mouse. Sliders and buttons are provided for choosing colors, shape types, size, and more.

A second feature of the assignment includes recreating a hand-drawn sketch using only colored triangles rendered via WebGL. See `asg1.html` for the complete experience.

## Features

âœ… Click or drag to draw on the canvas  
âœ… Choose between **Point**, **Triangle**, and **Circle** brushes  
âœ… Control color using **RGB sliders**  
âœ… Adjust shape size using a **size slider**  
âœ… Adjust circle smoothness via **segment slider**  
âœ… Clear the canvas  
âœ… Draw a **custom image using triangles** (see below)  
âœ… Modular and organized JavaScript (OOP and WebGL best practices)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open `asg1.html` in a web browser.**
2. Use the UI elements to:
   - Select shape type (Point, Triangle, Circle)
   - Adjust brush size
   - Choose color (R, G, B sliders)
   - Select number of segments for circles
   - Clear canvas
   - Render a triangle-based illustration with a button
3. For bonus awesomeness, check the rendered image based on the provided sketch.

## Custom Triangle Drawing

A sketch (e.g., `cse160_boat.jpg`) was drawn by hand and then recreated in WebGL using individual triangle shapes. Press the **"Draw Boat"** (or similar) button on the page to view the recreated version.

---

## Getting Started

No build tools or server required.

1. Just open `asg1.html` in a browser with WebGL support (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
2. Ensure all `lib/` files are accessible in the same directory structure.
3. Interact with the canvas to paint or render the sketch!
